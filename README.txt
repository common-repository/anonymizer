This plugin Anonymizes a blog's users and commenters by replacing their display names with randomized names and suppressing personal e-mails and urls.

== Description ==

This plug-in Anonymizes a blog's users and commenters by replacing their display names with randomized and suppressing personal e-mails and urls.

Using the administrative sections, Administrators and Editors have ways of being able to identify original users.

This plugin was built for an MU environment, so it will create a different display name for each user in every blog that employs it.

== Installation ==

1. Download the Plugin's Zip file. 
1. Place the anonymizer directory (and its contents) into your plugins directory
1. Activate the plugin

== Customization ==

names.txt controls the names that are returned by this plugin. You can create your own list of names and use it instead. Your file should have one name per line.

This list is based on the top 10 male and female names from most of the countries in the world (as reported in Wikipedia.)
